						<h1>Customer Service Indicators</h1>
    					<h3>If it were easy, everyone would do it.</h3>
						<p>At Saia, we go to extreme lengths to provide the industry's highest level of service. That's why over a decade ago, we launched our innovative Customer Service Indicators (CSIs). These were the result of extensive research during which we asked customers what information they needed to make their transportation buying decisions. Based on their feedback, we developed our CSIs. They measure the key metrics customers said were most important to them.</p>
						<p>Since their inception, our CSIs have been the basis for Saia's ongoing operational improvement as we constantly monitor our performance, evaluate each metric's importance to our customers, and research new ways to improve our service. In this vein, we are excited to announce that we have launched our newest CSI, <span class="bold">Exception-free Delivery</span>. This latest metric measures the percentage of shipments that deliver undamaged and complete each month. We are the only carrier to report on this critical measurement.</p>
